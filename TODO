------------------------ KNOWN BUGS------------------------
- Pausing does not pause timers

- When two bandits are approaching while looking through
scope, sometimes the scale of the front bandit resets back
a little. It seems like the flicker happens when the 2nd
bandit enters the scopedScreen distance. Recreate bug by
spawning two bandits seperated by about two player models
worth of space and run far to the left/right where they are
out of view in scopeScreen, wait until they come into view
