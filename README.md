# Journeys-Wild West



The Wild West was a dangerous time to be alive.
With a six-shooter on your hip and a sniper rifle on your back, you are unstoppable.
Eliminate as many bandits as you can!

â€Ž

**JOURNEYS**, is a collection of **minigames** written in Python.

From slaying zombies with magic and gunning down western bandits, to begging for spare change and strolling around a little town, you can expect to explore a wide variety of experiences through JOURNEYS minigames.
